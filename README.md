# 📖 About

This tool automates the configuration of a Microverse Project.

# 🆕 Updates

# 🤩 In Progress

# 💻 Getting Started

> When you run the tool, you will be presented with a list of options. To select multiple configurations, simply use the space bar. Once you have chosen the configurations you need, press enter and wait for the script to complete its tasks.

Start by cloning the repository to your home user directory.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/wwwdrt/MicroverseSetup.git
```

Now move inside the directory MicroverseSetup and copy the `Setup.js` binary into your project root directory.

Finally run the tool `node Setup.js`.

# 🤔 Confused?

This is the way I run the commands in the Getting Started:

```bash
cd ~/ && git clone https://github.com/wwwdrt/MicroverseSetup.git

cp Setup.js ~/MicroverseProjects/My_New_Project

cd ~/MicroverseProjects/My_New_Project

node Setup.js
```
