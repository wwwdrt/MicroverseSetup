Start by cloning the repository to your home user directory.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/wwwdrt/MicroverseSetup.git
```

Now move inside the directory MicroverseSetup and copy the `Setup.js` binary into your project root directory.

Finally run the tool `node Setup.js`.

# 🤔 Confused?

This is the way I run the commands in the Getting Started:

```bash
cd ~/ && git clone https://github.com/wwwdrt/MicroverseSetup.git

cp Setup.js ~/MicroverseProjects/My_New_Project

cd ~/MicroverseProjects/My_New_Project

node Setup.js
```
